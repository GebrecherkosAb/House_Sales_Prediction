# House Sales Python

The project is about determining the market price of a house given a set of features for a real estate investment trust. Analyzes and predicts housing prices using attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. I have used the Jupyter Notebook through IBM Watson studio to do this project. The dataset used on this project contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle. It has homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
